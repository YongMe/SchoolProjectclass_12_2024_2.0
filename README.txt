Folders numbered >> 999 are ready to process but `only the label numbers will be corrected later on` 
Any files outside any folder are experimental.
Inputs and Outputs are workable
- Change the comments(mandatory) ----> they will be later on changed in the files too
- Change the variables names if possible.
- Change the names of the class
The varialbe description tables will be inspected later on
other programs, IO files, variable description tables and algorithms will be uploaded soon.....
